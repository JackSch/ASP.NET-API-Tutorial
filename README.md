# README

A project walking through the book *The Complete ASP.NET Core 3 API Tutorial*, authored by Les Jackson, 2020.

Project and packages updated to .NET 6 for compatibility with deploying to Azure App Service. Code remains unchanged, however.

I highly recommend this book for programming newbies learning C#/.NET, such as myself.
